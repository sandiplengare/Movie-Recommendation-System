The Movie Recommendation System is a data-driven application that suggests movies to users based on their viewing history, preferences, and behavior. Using advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques, this system analyzes user interactions, ratings, and movie metadata to provide personalized movie recommendations. Users can discover new movies they might enjoy, enhancing their entertainment experience and increasing user engagement on the platform. This project aims to deliver a seamless and enjoyable movie-watching experience by leveraging the power of data-driven recommendations.
